# Fire-fighting-Robot
The Firefighting Robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to detect and extinguish fires. It is equipped with sensors to identify fire sources and a suppression mechanism to mitigate risks. This project is useful for small-scale fire emergencies and educational purposes in robotics and automation.

#Overview
This project is an Arduino-based Firefighting Robot designed to detect and extinguish fire. The robot uses sensors to identify the presence of fire and activates a mechanism to suppress it. It is ideal for autonomous fire detection in small areas.

#Features

Fire Detection: Uses flame sensors to detect fire.

Autonomous Movement: Navigates towards the fire source.

Fire Extinguishing System: Activates a fan or water pump to suppress the fire.

Real-Time Monitoring: Displays sensor readings on the serial monitor.
